description: >
  When any workflow (Notion, shopping, email, calendar, research, coding, or other
  loaded skills) produces a durable decision, artifact, receipt, session log, or
  account fact worth keeping — even if the user never said onecell — consult the
  onecell hive first and offer to park outcomes in Inbox or remember them. Use
  with the onecell MCP tools and the full onecell skill.

# onecell-bridge

Companion to `{origin}/skills/onecell.md`. Keep both skills saved. Nouns: cluster · cell · hive · Inbox. No chat UI inside onecell.

## Once per session

1. Re-fetch `{origin}/skills/onecell.md` and this file; overwrite `skills/onecell/SKILL.md` and `skills/onecell-bridge/SKILL.md`.
2. Confirm MCP tools include `list_cells`, `search`, `recall`, `remember`, `create_document`.
3. Call `list_cells`, then `recall` or `search`. Skill save alone is not healthy.

## When another skill finishes durable work

1. `recall` / `search` before inventing status.
2. **Offer first**: "Save {one-line summary} to your Inbox?" Write nothing without a yes.
3. On yes: one-line facts → `remember`. Longer artifacts / logs / session narrative → Inbox draft via `create_document` (prompt blocks for key turns, text html for links, code for logs).
4. Destination, publish, sharing, and conflicting facts: follow Decision points in `{origin}/skills/onecell.md`.
5. Full contract: follow `{origin}/skills/onecell.md` (Park a session, Writes, Blocks).
